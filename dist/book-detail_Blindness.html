It is one of Saramago's most famous novels, along with <cite>The Gospel According to Jesus Christ</cite> and <cite>Baltasar and Blimunda</cite>. In <time datetime="1998">1998</time>, Saramago received the <cite>Nobel Prize for Literature</cite>, and Blindness was one of his works noted by the committee when announcing the award. </p> <blockquote cite="https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/3213039-ensaio-sobre-a-cegueira"> <p> "I don't think we did go blind, I think we are blind, Blind but seeing, Blind people who can see, but do not see." </p> </blockquote> <p> A city is hit by an epidemic of "white blindness" that spares no one. Authorities confine the blind to an empty mental hospital, but there the criminal element holds everyone captive, stealing food rations, and assaulting women. There is one eyewitness to this nightmare who guides her charges—among them a boy with no mother, a girl with dark glasses, a dog of tears—through the barren streets, and their procession becomes as uncanny as the surroundings are harrowing. </p> <p> As Blindness reclaims the age-old story of a plague, it evokes the vivid and trembling horrors of the twentieth century, leaving readers with a powerful vision of the human spirit that's bound both by weakness and exhilarating strength. </p> </section> </div> <section class="plot-summary"> <h3>Summary</h3> <p> Blindness is the story of an unexplained mass epidemic of blindness afflicting nearly everyone in an unnamed city, and the social breakdown that swiftly follows. The novel follows the misfortune of a handful of unnamed characters who are among the first to be stricken with blindness, including "the doctor's wife", her husband, several of his patients, and assorted others, who are thrown together by chance. After a lengthy and traumatic quarantine in an asylum, the group bands together in a family-like unit to survive by their wits and by the unexplained good fortune that the doctor's wife has escaped the blindness. The sudden onset and unexplained origin and nature of the blindness cause widespread panic, and the social order rapidly unravels as the government attempts to contain the apparent contagion and keep order via increasingly repressive and inept measures. </p> <figure> <img srcset="/blindness-2-S.0f341493.jpeg 320w,/blindness-2-M.0e52ac0f.jpeg 640w,/blindness-2-L.f4efaa7e.jpeg 1024w" sizes="

Hygiene, living conditions, and morale degrade horrifically in a very short period, mirroring the society outside. </p> <p> Anxiety over the availability of food, caused by delivery irregularities, acts to undermine solidarity; and lack of organization prevents the internees from fairly distributing food or chores. Soldiers assigned to guard the asylum and look after the well-being of the internees become increasingly antipathetic as one soldier after another becomes infected. The military refuses to allow basic medicine to be delivered, which ensures that a simple infection becomes deadly. Fearing an imminent escape, soldiers shoot down a crowd of internees waiting for a food delivery. </p> <figure> <picture> <source media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/blindness-1-S.e9809c84.jpeg"> <source media="(max-width: 850px)" srcset="/blindness-1-M.976274c2.jpeg"> <source media="(max-width: 1024px)" srcset="/blindness-1-L.95b6da6b.jpeg"> <img src="/blindness-1-L.95b6da6b.jpeg" alt="Empty street image"> </picture> <figcaption> Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@dalenpdx" target="_blank">Dale Nibbe </a> </figcaption> </figure> <p> Conditions degenerate further as an armed clique gains control over food deliveries, subjugating their fellow internees and exposing them to violent assault, rape, and deprivation. Faced with starvation, internees battle each other and burn down the asylum, only to discover that the army has abandoned the asylum, after which the protagonists join the throngs of nearly helpless blind people outside who wander the devastated city and fight one another to survive. </p> <figure> <img srcset="/blindness-4-S.65cc475e.jpeg 320w,/blindness-4-M.25775b4f.jpeg 640w,/blindness-4-L.f383d462.jpeg 1024w" sizes="

At this point, the breakdown of society is near total. Law and order, social services, government, schools, etc., no longer function. Families have been separated and cannot find one another. People squat in abandoned buildings and scrounge for food. Violence, disease, and despair threaten to overwhelm human coping. The doctor and his wife and their new “family” eventually make a permanent home in the doctor's house and are establishing a new order to their lives when the blindness lifts from the city en masse just as suddenly and inexplicably as it struck. </p> </section> <section class="detail-audiobook"> <h3>Audiobook</h3> <div class="embed-video"> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EipKpoD6vPM" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> </div> <p class="video-caption"> Blindness <em>by José Saramago</em>.

Bloom and Saramago met when Saramago presented Bloom with an honorary degree from the University of Coimbra; according to <cite>Bloom</cite>: "A warm acquaintanceship ensued, marked by an exegetical disagreement concerning The Gospel According to Jesus Christ, which continued in correspondence and at a later meeting in New York City". </p> <p> More than two million copies of Saramago's books have been sold in Portugal alone and his work has been translated into 25 languages. A proponent of libertarian communism, Saramago criticized institutions such as the Catholic Church, the European Union and the International Monetary Fund. An atheist, he defended love as an instrument to improve the human condition. In <time datetime="1992">1992</time>, the Government of Portugal under <cite>Prime Minister Aníbal Cavaco Silva</cite> ordered the removal of one of his works, The Gospel According to Jesus Christ, from the Aristeion Prize's shortlist, claiming the work was religiously offensive.
