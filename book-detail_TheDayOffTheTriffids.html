                            The Day of the Triffids is a 1951 post-apocalyptic novel by the English science fiction author <cite>John Wyndham</cite>. After most people in the world are blinded by an apparent meteor shower, an aggressive species of plant starts killing people.

                            The narrative begins with Bill Masen in hospital, his eyes bandaged after having been splashed with triffid poison from a stinger. During his convalescence he is told of an unexpected green meteor shower. The next morning, he learns that the light from the unusual display has rendered any who watched it blind (later in the book, Masen speculates that the "meteor shower" may have been orbiting satellite weapons, triggered accidentally). After unbandaging his eyes he finds the hospital in chaos, with staff and patients without sight. He wanders through a chaotic London full of blind inhabitants and slowly becomes enamoured of wealthy novelist Josella Playton, whom he rescues after discovering her being forcibly used as a guide by a blind man. Intrigued by a single light on top of the Senate House in an otherwise darkened London, Bill and Josella discover a group of sighted survivors led by a man named Beadley, who plans to establish a colony in the countryside. They decide to join the group.

                          <p> 
                            The polygamy implicit in Beadley's scheme appalls some group members, especially the religious Miss Durrant—but before this schism can be dealt with, a man named Wilfred Coker stages a fire at the university and kidnaps a number of sighted individuals, including Bill and Josella. They are each chained to a blind person and assigned to lead a squadron of the blind, collecting food and other supplies, all the while beset by escaped triffids and rival scavengers.

                    John Wyndham Parkes Lucas Beynon Harris (<time datetime="1903-07-10">10 July 1903</time> – <time datetime="1969-03-11">11 March 1969</time>) was an English science fiction writer best known for his works published under the pen name John Wyndham, although he also used other combinations of his names, such as John Beynon and Lucas Parkes. Some of his works were set in post-apocalyptic landscapes. His best known works include <cite>The Day of the Triffids</cite> (1951) and <cite>The Midwich Cuckoos</cite> (1957), the latter filmed twice as Village of the Damned.

                  <p>
                    His early childhood was spent in Edgbaston in Birmingham, but when he was 8 years old his parents separated. His father then attempted to sue the Parkes family for "the custody, control and society" of his wife and family, in an unusual and high-profile court case, which he lost. Following this embarrassment Gertrude left Birmingham to live in a series of boarding houses and spa hotels. He and his younger brother, the writer <cite>Vivian Beynon Harris</cite>, spent the rest of their childhoods at a number of English preparatory and public schools, including <cite>Blundell's School</cite> in Tiverton, Devon, during the <cite>First World War</cite>. His longest and final stay was at <cite>Bedales School</cite>, near Petersfield in Hampshire (1918–21), which he left at the age of 18, and where he blossomed and was happy.
